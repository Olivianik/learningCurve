The two main configuration terms is context and directive.
Directives, is a specific configuration options that get set in the configuration files and consist of a name and a value.
Context on the other hand, is sections within the configuration where directives can be set for that given context.
Essentially, context is the same as scope and like scope.
Context are also nested and inherit from their parents with the topmost context simply being the configuration file itself.
This is called the main context and is where we configure global directives that apply to the master process.
Are the important contexts include the HTTP context for anything HTTP related,
the server context, which is where we define a virtual host similar to an Apache host
location context for matching URI locations on incoming requests to the parent server context.
Again, when using the engine documentation, these terms will be used for each directive.
